# DeepLearning_Predicting_BikeSharing_Patterns
## Overview 
Built a neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership

## Details of the Neural Network
The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. 

## Hyperparameters used
* iterations = 5000
* learning_rate = 0.5
* hidden_nodes = 30
* output_nodes = 1
